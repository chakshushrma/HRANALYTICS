What it's about:
This project focused on understanding why employees leave a company by analyzing HR data.

What was done:
I used Power BI to create a dashboard from a dataset of 1,470 employees. I added filters and used DAX formulas to analyze trends like which departments had the highest attrition, what age groups were leaving, and how job satisfaction affected attrition.

Why it matters:
This helps HR teams find problem areas and take action to keep valuable employees, improving overall employee satisfaction and reducing hiring costs.
